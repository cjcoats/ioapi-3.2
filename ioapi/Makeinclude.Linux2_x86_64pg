#
#  In some ways, this is the most problematical install, because of 
#  the way  various compilers create linker-visible object names for
#  the code they compile.  The default flags assume that you are using
#  the Gnu "gcc" (and maybe "g77") to compile other libraries such as
#  "libnetcdf.a" and "libpvm3.a"  -- note that  vendor-distributed
#  libraries that may come with your Linux system are built this way...
#  Alternatively, you may use "pgf90" and "pgcc" to build the entire
#  system (where you use "-DpgiFortran=1" in your netCDF build), and
#  then may use the alternate set of ARCHFLAGS.
#
#  The important thing is that _all_ the compilations for building an
#  executable must use consistent linker-visible object names.  Any
#  "could not find" error messages when linking a program probably
#  come from this kind of problem; the fix is to rebuild everything
#  with a consistent set of compiler-flags.  You may use the script
#  "nm_test.csh" and/or "make nametest" to help with this determination.
#
#  Note all the variant files "Makeinclude.Linux2_x86pg*": copy the
#  appropriate one to "Makeinclude.Linux2_x86pg"; further ensure that
#  the compilation-flags for your model-code match the flags therein.
