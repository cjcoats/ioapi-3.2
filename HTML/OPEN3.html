<H1>    OPEN3()  and  open3c() </H1>

<H2> Fortran version: </H2>
<PRE>
    LOGICAL FUNCTION  OPEN3( FNAME, FSTATUS, PGNAME )
        CHARACTER*(*), INTENT(IN   ) :: FNAME   !  file name for query
        INTEGER      , INTENT(IN   ) :: FSTATUS !  FSREAD3, FSRDWR3, FSNEW3, FSUNKN3, FSCREA3
        CHARACTER*(*), INTENT(IN   ) :: PGNAME  !  name of calling program
</PRE><P> 

<H2> C version: </H2>  open3c() is a C wrapper calling the Fortran OPEN3()
<PRE>
    int open3c( const char          * fname ,
                const IOAPI_Bdesc3  * bdesc ,
                const IOAPI_Cdesc3  * cdesc ,
                int                   fstatus ,
                const char          * pgname ) ;
</PRE><P> 

<H2> See Also:</H2> 
    <A HREF = "PROMPTMFILE.html">PROMPTMFILE()</A>,
    which is a (text-mode interactive) wrapper around OPEN3() that
    prompts the user for the logical name of the file to be opened.
    <P> 
    Also see <A HREF = "GETDFILE.html">GETDFILE()</A> and
    <A HREF = "GETEFILE.html">GETEFILE()</A>, for opening
    Fortran sequential and direct access files by logical name.
    <P> 

<H2> Summary: </H2>
    Open or create Models-3 file with <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> 
    logical name </A> FNAME, with  file mode/status FSTATUS of one of 
    the following 
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#magic"> &quot;magic number&quot; tokens </A> 
    (defined in INCLUDE-file 
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#parms">  PARMS3.EXT </A>):
<PRE>
    FSREAD3==1 for read-only,
    FSRDWR3==2 for read/write/update of existing files,
    FSNEW3 ==3 for read/write of new files (file must not
               already exist),
    FSUNKN3==4 for read/write/update of unknown (new vs. old)
               files.  If file does not exist, create it; 
               else check for consistency with user-supplied
               file description.
    FSCREA3==5 for create/truncate/read/write of files.
               If file exists, delete it; then create a new
               (empty) file according to the user-supplied
               file description
</PRE><P> 

    If FNAME is being opened for write, copies 
    <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> scenario description </A>
    from file with logical name SCENDESC, name PGNAME of the 
    caller, and value of 
    <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> environment variable </A>
    EXECUTION_ID to 
    the file's history (maintained in the file header).
    <P> 
    
    If file may possibly be created (i.e., if the access mode is
    either FSNEW3, FSUNKN3, or FSCREA3), the user must supply a file
    description in the COMMONs in INCLUDE-file 
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> FDESC3.EXT </A> (for
    Fortran) or in the data structures pointed to by arguments
    bdesc and cdesc (for C).  In the latter case, the file
    description struct pointers are only required when the file is
    being opened &quot;new&quot; or &quot;unknown&quot;.
    <P> 

    &quot;Normal&quot; modeling usage should be to open input files as
    <CODE>FSREAD3</CODE> and output files as <CODE>FSUNKN3</CODE>.  If
    you open output files  as <CODE>FSNEW3</CODE>, you must take care
    to remove pre-existing files before running your program.
    <P>

    <STRONG>NOTE: </STRONG> Joan Novak (EPA)  and Ed Bilicki (MCNC) 
    have declared as a software standard that <STRONG>modeling programs
    may not  use FSCREA3 as the mode for opening files.</STRONG>  
    FSCREA3 is reserved for use by analysis/data extraction programs
    only.
    <P>

    May be called multiple times for a file (provided you don't
    attempt to go from readonly to any read/write status).

<H2> Preconditions: </H2>  

    <CODE><A HREF = "M3UTILIO.html">USE M3UTILIO</A></CODE> or
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#iodecl"> 
    <CODE>INCLUDE 'IODECL3.EXT'</CODE> </A> 
    and 
    <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> 
    <CODE>INCLUDE 'FDESC3.EXT'</CODE> </A> 
    for Fortran, or <BR>
    <CODE>#include &quot;iodecl3.h&quot;</CODE> and 
    <CODE>#include &quot;fdesc3.h&quot;</CODE> for C.
    <P> 

    <CODE>FNAME</CODE> must have length at most 16.
    <P> 
    
    For <CODE>FSREAD3</CODE> or <CODE>FSRDWR3</CODE>, file must already exist.
    <P> 
    
    For <CODE>FSNEW3</CODE>, file must <EM>not</EM> already exist.
    <P> 
    
    For <CODE>FSUNKN3</CODE>, if the file already exists, the file type,
    dimensions, time step and variables supplied by the caller must
    match those on the file.  The caller-supplied starting date and time
    must be a legal output time step in the time step sequence found on
    the file:  for example, if the starting time from the file header
    is 1997012:120000, and the time step is one hour (10000), then
    opening this file  <CODE>FSUNKN3</CODE> with a caller-supplied
    starting date and time of 1997012:180000 is OK (that would be
    time step number 7 for the file-header time step sequence) but
    a caller-supplied 1997011:120000 is not, since it is before the
    starting date and time from the file itself.
    <P> 
    
    For FSNEW3, FSUNKN3, or FSCREA3, caller must supply file description
    (which must follow Models-3 <A HREF = "DATETIME.html"> 
    date and time conventions </A>).
    <P> 
    
    I/O API must already be initialized by a call to 
    <A HREF = "INIT3.html"> INIT3() or init3c(). </A>
    <P> 
    
    OPEN3() must not be called for read/write/update (FSRDWR3, FSNEW3,
    FSUNK3, or FSCREA3) on a file already open for read-only (FSREAD3).
    <P>

    OPEN3() must not be called for new (FSNEW3) on a file already
    open.
