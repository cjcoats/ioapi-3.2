<H2>Introduction</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    This document started as the set of standards for the EPA Models-3
    project, and was continued by the author while at the North Carolina
    Supercomputing Center, then at Baron Advanced Meteorological
    Systems, LLC. [BAMS], and now at UNC's Institute for the
    Environment. It is the software development standard under which the
    Models-3 I/O&nbsp;API, the MAQSIP air quality model, the NCSC/BAMS
    operational-forecast tools and models, and various other software
    systems were and are maintained.  It is offered here for use with
    such other projects as may find it useful.
    <P>
    (There are still some &quot;dangling&quot; BAMS references, e.g.,
    to the Chief Architect, Chief Operations Officer, <EM>test</EM> vs
    <EM>production</EM> repositories, etc.  These give some level of
    recognition to the importance of the items that reference them.)

    REVIEW
</A></H2>

   <BLOCKQUOTE>

    Review processes are envisioned as a mechanism providing control and
    feedback into the analysis, design, implementation, testing, and use
    of software and data.  It is expected that the scope and extent of
    the review processes will be highly dependent upon the size and
    complexity of the software being reviewed.
    <P>

    The resources required are mostly the time of the personnel
    involved, and should usually amount to about  10 - 20 % of the
    man-hours required for the initial software development.
    <P>

    It should be recognized that the review processes should not only
    result in higher quality in the software developed, but also in the
    increased communication and software development expertise of the
    personnel involved.
    <P>

    At the present time, review shall require design and/or code walk
    through that involves the Chief Architect and the Chief Operations
    Officer or his designate.
    <P>

   Design review objectives include the following:
   <UL>
       <LI>  faithful representation -- i. e., that design accurately
            addresses the requirements

       <LI>  good representation:
             <UL>
                <LI>  feasible
                <LI>  modular and flexible
                <LI>  technically sound
                <LI>  structurally sound (good, robust design choices)
             </UL>

       <LI>  design standards are met
       <LI>  adequate test design specified.
   </UL>
   <P>

   Code review objectives include the following</P>
   <UL>
       <LI> code accurately follows the design
       <LI> structurally sound (well-thought-out) implementation
       <LI> coding standards met (implies readability)
       <LI> testing performed adequately
   </UL>
   <P>

   An especially important aspect of design and code is that of
   <STRONG>interfaces</STRONG>.<BR>
   Interfaces include:
   <P>
   <UL>

       <LI> <EM>Shared state</EM>, e.g., a situation where an operation
            is split across several different subroutines (etc.) which
            must cooperate in order to perform that operation.

       <LI> <EM>Preconditions</EM> (what must be done before invocation) and
            <EM>postconditions</EM>P (what is guaranteed to be true after
            invocation)

       <LI> The set of <EM>input and output data structures</EM>, particularly
            the input and output files,

       <LI> The set of <EM>environment variables</EM> required (including logical
            file names),

       <LI> The <EM>names</EM> of the variables read from or written to those files

       <LI> The <EM>sequence of prompts</EM> required by the program (and the
            meaning of the responses to those prompts).

       <LI> return status

       <LI> For <CODE>PROGRAM</CODE>s, interfaces include whatever else
            is required in order to write a script for the program.

       <LI> For <CODE>MODULE</CODE>s, interfaces include all <CODE>PUBLIC</CODE>
            entities.
            <BLOCKQUOTE>
            Note that it is good practice for <CODE>PUBLIC</CODE>
            entities only to include <CODE>TYPE</CODE>s,
            <CODE>PARAMETER</CODE>s, <CODE>SUBROUTINE</CODE>s and
            <CODE>FUNCTION</CODE>s, and  <CODE>PROTECTED</CODE> variables.
            <P>
            Module variables generally should be <CODE>PRIVATE</CODE>.
            In a few exceptional cases, variables may be
            <CODE>PUBLIC,&nbsp;PROTECTED</CODE>, in order to give
            read-only access to their values to code that <CODE>USE</CODE>s
            the module.
            </BLOCKQUOTE>

       <LI> For <CODE>SUBROUTINE</CODE>s and <CODE>FUNCTION</CODE>s,
            interfaces include the arguments and their
            <CODE>INTENT</CODE>s, the preconditions, and the
            postconditions.
    </UL>
    <P>

    Good design, with modularity and flexibility, is largely the art
    of finding that separation of software into components which
    yields the best and simplest set of interfaces, where each task
    is internally cohesive, and produces internally consistent
    objects that are then inputs to other processes.
    <P>

    Generally, interfaces should be kept as simple--and as
    standardized--as possible.  For example:
    <P>
    <UL>

        <LI> Minimize shared state.<BR>
             Separating initialization from computation is a violation of
             the shared-state/cohesive-components/simple-interfaces principle.

        <LI> <EM><A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiarity">Subsidiarity:</A></EM>
             Declare variables (etc.) at the most local scope consistent
             with their use.<BR>
             For example, declaring a <CODE>MODULE</CODE>-variable that is
             allocated and deallocated within a particular subroutine,
             and is used only in that subroutine and its callees is a
             violation:  that variable should have been local to that
             subroutine.

        <LI> Having multiple specialized names for multiple variables
             with the same functionality, for the purpose of
             distinguishing what program produced that variable is a
             violation of interface simplicity and standardization.
             If variables are functionally interchangeable, they ought
             to have the same name.

        <LI> Requiring management-oriented metadata as part of an
             interface is a violation of interface simplicity and
             component cohesion.
     </UL>

    <H3>General Requirements</H3>
    <UL>

       <LI> Where possible, internal names should match external-interface
            names.  For example, if an input file has a variable named
            <VAR>FOO</VAR> then the source code should also refer to that
            variable by the name <VAR>FOO</VAR> unless either multiple input
            variables named <VAR>FOO</VAR> are present or the name of the
            corresponding input variable is in fact a program-option.

       <LI> Program code must pass Chief Architect review before being
            accepted for the production repository.

            <P>

      <LI>  For modified programs, interfaces and program function shall
            not be changed without permission of the Chief Architect.
            <P>

      <LI>  The purpose of the main code repository is to maintain the
            <STRONG>main</STRONG> code path, not, e.g., 8 different versions
            of the code <CODE>noahr_mod.F90.begin_week_ncar</CODE>, ...
            <P>

                     customized copy, actually used for building codes.
                <LI> Updating <CODE>Makefile.template</CODE> is a

            </UL>
            <P>

              the success/failure status of the indicated operation, and
              shall log failures, preferably with the error-status value.
              (For M3IO <VAR>READ3()</VAR>, etc., the log-operation is
              done automatically; still, however, success/failure status
              shall be checked, and the program code shall act
              accordingly.)

              error-status and record-identifier information as is
              available.  In principle, the text of the error-message
              shall be sufficient to determine the exact location and
              reason for program termination.

              It is <STRONG>metadata perjury</STRONG> to specify this

              Use of <CODE>INTENT(INOUT)</CODE> is a red flag indicating
              probable bad modularity, as it tends to indicate splitting

        <LI>  Loops and block constructions (<CODE>IF-THEN...ELSE IF...ELSE...

        <LI>  Loop beginning and loop ending for loops constructed with

              or an <CODE>IF-THEN-ELSE</CODE> block from outside the

              implement them by &quot;Start WW-III&quot;, they're within
              their rights and we don't want to be stuck with it.
              <P>

        <LI>  Avoid use of tabs in Fortran source code:  they mean
              different things to different systems, and make use of
              indentation-tools difficult.
              <P>

        <LI>  <CODE>REAL</CODE> or <CODE>COMPLEX</CODE> variables shall not be
              tested for equality. This is not numerically robust nor
              reliable.
              <P>

        <LI>  Free source form is preferred for new projects and codes.<BR>
              Where possible, program code should fit within columns
              1-80 (and cols 1-120 in all cases).
              <P>

        <LI>  Comment text should be in lower case, and program code should be

              <P>

        <LI>  Comments should be separated from program-code sufficiently that
              neither one interferes with the reading of the other
              (either by having block comments interspersed with blocks
              of code and set off by blank lines, or by having comments
              in the right margin, with program code on the left.
              <P>

        <LI>  Whitespace and blank lines should be used to set off constructs
              and to emphasize commonality, to enhance readability.  E.g.,
              <PRE>
        X  ( IROW ) = EE  +  SIN ( B * C ) / D
        YAB( IROW ) = EE  +  B**2  -  C**2

        X(IROW)=EE+SIN(B*C)/D
        YAB(IROW)=EE+B**2-C**2
              </PRE>
              <P>

        <LI>  Indentation shall be in multiples of four columns, with
              initiation and termination at the same level (e.g., a
              <CODE>DO</CODE> and its terminating <CODE>END DO</CODE> start at
              the same column) (&quot;Algol/Wirth/Whitesmith&quot; style
              indentation).
              <P>

        <LI>  Continuation-line code shall be indented at least 6 spaces
              beyond the current indentation level.
              <P>

        <LI>  Parallel directives shall use the same indentation as
              other source code.
              <P>

        <LI>  The use of zeros where needed on either side of a decimal point
               to enhance readability of floating-point constants is
               preferred, e.g.,  <CODE>1.0</CODE> and <CODE>0.007</CODE>
               instead of <CODE>1.</CODE> and <CODE>.007</CODE>.
              <P>

        <LI>  Do not use repeated divisions in Fortran expressions:
              e.g., use <CODE>FOO/(BAR*QUX)</CODE> instead of
              <CODE>FOO/BAR/QUX</CODE>:
              <BR>
              (a)&nbsp;Fortran precedence rules are the opposite of normal
              algebra rules, and this does lead to confusion and to
              obscure bugs; and
              <BR>
              (b)&nbsp;divisions are typically 30-100x more expensive than
              multiplications, so is inefficient anyway.
              <BR>
              Those meteorology professors who encourage this practice
              should be <STRONG>shot</STRONG>!  (For the most part,
              fractions in &quot;first normal form&quot; are most readable
              and most efficient: numerator, with parenthesis as
              necessary, and with constants leading more complex
              sub-expressions, a divide-symbol, then denominator, with
              parentheses as necessary, and with constants leading more
              complex sub-expressions.)
              <P>

        <LI>  Code with numerical round-off properties in mind.  In
              particular, avoid things like the following stupidity out
              of MCIP (with a divide by GSFC at the end of
              <VAR>F3</VAR>, and the a multiply by it in
              <VAR>RSTOMI(C,R)</VAR>, accomplishing only round-off
              error and wasting CPU time on an (expensive)
              divide-operation):
              <PRE>
        F3 = 0.5 * ( GSFC - GA + SQRT( GA * GA
 &amp;                         + GA * GSFC * (4.0 * Q1C / QSS - 2.0)
 &amp;                                   + GSFC * GSFC ) ) / GSFC
        RSTOMI(C,R) = GSFC * F3
              </PRE>
              <P>

        <LI>  Where possible, avoid use of explicit <CODE>KIND</CODE>s:
              I/O&nbsp;API data is &quot;default&quot; <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>,
              <CODE>REAL</CODE>, <CODE>DOUBLE PRECISION</CODE>, and you may
              cause obscure, hard-to-diagnose bugs.  Moreover,
              <STRONG>explicit  usages such as
              <CODE>REAL(KIND=4)&nbsp;FOO</CODE> are incorrect and work only
              by vendor-choice accident:  the standard does NOT equate
              such a declaration to <CODE>IEEE REAL*4</CODE> or other
              4-byte real. </STRONG>
              <P>

        <LI>  New codes should <CODE>USE&nbsp;M3UTILIO</CODE> instead of
              <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE>ing I/O&nbsp;API <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE>
              files (<CODE>PARMS3.EXT, FDESC3.EX, IODECL3.EXT,</CODE>
              etc.).  This not only is a substantial convenience, it also
              allows the compiler to check argument-list compatibility for
              most I/O&nbsp;API calls.
              <P>

        <LI>  Generally, modeling codes should not use
              <CODE>CLOSE3()</CODE>: in a modular model such as
              <CODE>MAQSIP</CODE> or <CODE>CMAQ</CODE>, file-state is a
              global model property, and changing it in one module can
              violate the environment of a different module.  The one
              acceptable use is for intialization/restart situations
              where one may want be able to do the following kind of
              sequence:
              <PRE>
      IF ( OPEN3( 'INIT_STUFF', FSREAD3, PNAME ) ) THEN
          ...
      END IF
      IF ( .NOT.CLOSE3( 'INIT_STUFF' ) ) THEN
          ...we have an error to process...
      ELSE IF ( OPEN3( 'OUTPUT_STUFF', FSUNKN3, PNAME ) ) THEN
          ...
      END IF
              </PRE>
              where for a &quot;cold-start&quot; initialization,
              <CODE>INIT_STUFF</CODE> is the cold-start initialization
              file and  <CODE>OUTPUT_STUFF</CODE> is the new output file,
              but for a restart, <CODE>INIT_STUFF</CODE>
              <CODE>OUTPUT_STUFF</CODE> are the same file, and we are
              using <CODE>CLOSE3</CODE> to avoid having the same physical
              file open in different (read-only vs read-write) modes under
              two different names, which might lead to data corruption.
              (You may recall we rather had to jump through hoops --
              generating obscure warning messages -- to avoid this
              problems without using <CODE>CLOSE3</CODE> in
              <VAR>MAQSIP</VAR>.
