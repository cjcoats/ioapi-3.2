<H1>    On The Definition of <A HREF = "#horiz"> Horizontal </A> and

        Grids and Coordinates for Models-3  </H1>

        
<H2> <A NAME = "horiz"> Horizontal </A> Coordinates and Grids </H2>

At this time, we assume that much of the data for Models-3 will be
presented as data on horizontally-regular grids.  Queries of the data
indexing system will specify the grid on which the data exists
as part of the query.  Computational processes may need to know
both the geometry and the geographic descriptive parameters  of 
these grids and the underlying coordinate systems for their own
purposes.
<P> 

Because of the ill-conditioned nature of arithmetic relating to
coordinate transformations, descriptive parameters are kept in
<EM>double precision</EM> (identifier tokens and dimensioning parameters
being of course integers). 
<P> 

Grids and coordinate systems (map projections) are 
<EM>named entities</EM>, for purposes of unambiguous tracking and 
database storage.  Names are CHARACTER*16 strings (consistent with 
the rest of the &quot;name&quot; objects manipulated within the 
I/O system).  There are finite (and extensible) lists of names of 
coordinate systems and of grids currently in use within the Models-3 
system. I would not anticipate that we should need more than a
few thousand such grids.  So that they are fully self-contained,
both names and complete descriptions for grids and coordinate systems 
(as specified below) are kept in file headers, and stored also in 
file description data structures in 
<A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> <CODE>FDESC3.EXT</CODE> or 
<CODE>fdesc3.h </CODE></A>.
<P> 

There is a software subsystem for manipulating map projections,
grids, and coordinates (see <A HREF="AA.html#coordstuff">the
User-Manual section on Coordinate and Grid Related Routines</A>).
An implementation of grid parameter access capabilities is given by
the <A HREF = "DSCGRID.html"><STRONG>DSCGRID()</STRONG> </A> routine,
which reads its accompanying ASCII data file <A HREF = "GRIDDESC.html">
<STRONG>GRIDDESC</STRONG></A>.
<P>

A <A HREF = "GRIDDESC.txt"><STRONG>sample GRIDDESC file</STRONG></A>
describing the main computational grids for the SMRAQ regional seasonal
modeling effort (part of the Southern Oxidant Study), the OTAG study,
all of the standard ROM AQM computational grids, and all of the
standard Urban Airshed Model computational grids is available.
<P>

Capabilities of this software subsystem include the following:

<UL>
    <LI>  Retrieve coordinate system description by name

    <LI>  Retrieve grid description by name

    <LI>  transform between lat-lon and map projection
          coordinates

    <LI>  transform between map projection coordinates and
          grid-normal coordinates

    <LI>  Compute and store matrices used to perform grid-to-grid data
          transformations of various types (both interpolation and
          aggregation)

    <LI>  Perform grid-to-grid data transformations of these
          types

</UL><P>

<EM><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG>  Longitudes are presumed to be in the range
<CODE>[-180,180]</CODE>.  This is consistent with duly-enacted ISO
Standard 6709, treaty obligations since 1878, and several centuries of
common usage (as well as virtually all of the currently available GIS or
mapping software).  Beware that the WMO with its GRIB &quot;standards&quot;
violates all of these.  When you deal with WMO &quot;longitudes&quot;,
you will have to write special-purpose modeling-code hacks to transform
longitude-values into ISO-6709 compliant form.  Plotting WMO-style
data against a map will be particularly troublesome; sorry.

Definitions of irregular and unstructured grids require a much more 
complete setof descriptive parameters (e.g., the coordinates of the 
grid origin and lists of cell sizes in both the <VAR>X</VAR> and
<VAR>Y</VAR> directions) in addition to the two dimensioning parameters
and map projection specifications.  I do not know enough to suggest an
efficient characterization of such grids for Models-3 at this time, 
although irregular grids can certainly be handled by putting the grid 
geometry information into its own data file (what you might term a 
&quot;grid geometry file&quot;.  Note that the grid descriptions 
supported directly by the I/O&nbsp;API deal only with regular grids at 
this time (although it allows for the later provision of irregular- or
unstructured-grid file types).  <BR>
<STRONG>Note&nbsp;1</STRONG> The MPAS Earth-System model uses unstructured
Voronoi-complex grids for meteorology, land-surface, ocean, and
atmospheric chemistry modeling.  The I/O&nbsp;API provides some high level
I/O and grid utility data structures and routines in
<CODE><A HREF="MODMPASFIO.html">MODULE&nbsp;MODMPASFIO</A></CODE>.
The required data structures are quite complicated :-)<BR>
<STRONG>Note&nbsp;2</STRONG> The I/O API also provides some high level
I/O routines for &quot;raw&quot; netCDF gridded data in
<CODE><A HREF="MODNCFIO.html">MODULE&nbsp;MODNCFIO</A></CODE>.
<P> 

Data files (or their generalizations) carry a complete set of
parameters for both the map projection and the (regular-) grid 
description as attributes (e.g., within the file headers), so that 
the files stand alone, independent of external database or software
systems.  This self-description within file should be regarded as the
final authority on the file's contents, since it is not subject to
corruption or loss in the same way that an external system is.  (Of
course, this puts the demand on users that they define their files
correctly).  Where defining parameters are not applicable (e.g., when
one is creating an irregular-grid file with an accompanying geometry
file, the non-applicable parameters should be set to the standard
&quot;missing&quot; values <VAR>IMISS3</VAR> or <VAR>BADVAL3</VAR>
(defined in the <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#parms">PARMS.EXT</A> INCLUDE
file.  The relationship between the defining parameters and the
variables in <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc">FDESC.EXT</A> INCLUDE
file resident file description data structures is the following:
<UL>
        <LI>  grid name  is <STRONG>GDNAM3D</STRONG>
        <LI>  coordinate system type is <STRONG>GDTYP3D</STRONG>

<H2> <A NAME = "vert"> Vertical </A> Coordinates and Vertical Grids </H2>

Vertical-coordinate descriptions are put into file headers and likewise
into the file description data structures 
(<A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> <CODE>FDESC3.EXT</CODE> and
<CODE>fdesc3.h</CODE> </A>): vertical cordinate type specifier
<STRONG>VGTYP3D</STRONG> in <CODE>FDESC3.EXT</CODE>  and in file
headers takes values from a short list of vertical coordinate  types
with tokens for the types defined in <CODE>PARMS3.EXT</CODE>, as
follows:
<UL>
    <LI>  <STRONG>VGPRES3</STRONG>:  pressure coordinate (Pascals)
    <LI>  <STRONG>VGZVAL3</STRONG>:  Z (height above ground, meters)
    <LI>  <STRONG>VGHVAL3</STRONG>:  H (height above mean sea level, meters)
    <LI>  <STRONG>VGSGPH3</STRONG>:  hydrostatic sigma-P
    <LI>  <STRONG>VGSGPN3</STRONG>:  nonhydrostatic sigma-P
    <LI>  <STRONG>VGSIGZ3</STRONG>:  sigma-Z
    <LI>  <STRONG>VGWRFEM</STRONG>:  WRF mass-core (WRF-EM) dry-sigma
    <LI>  <STRONG>VGWRFNM</STRONG>:  WRF NMM-core vertical coordinate
    <LI>  <STRONG>IMISS3</STRONG>:  vertical coordinate type not applicable 
                                    (e.g., time-dependent vertical 
                                    coordinates), or &quot;other&quot;.
</UL>

The <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> <CODE>FDESC3.EXT</CODE> </A>
attribute <VAR>NLAYS3D</VAR> stores the actual number of layers in a
file.  Parameter <STRONG>MXLAYS3</STRONG>&nbsp;=&nbsp;100 in  <A HREF =
"INCLUDE.html#parms"> <CODE>PARMS3.EXT</CODE> </A> is used for 
dimensioning an array <STRONG>VGLVS3D(MXLAYS3+1)</STRONG> in 
<CODE>FDESC3.EXT</CODE> used to store the vertical coordinate values
for the file (up to  the dimensioned maximum, although files may have
an actual number of layers  in excess of this).  The array section
<VAR>VGLVS3D(1:NLAYS3D+1)</VAR> contains valid  values; subscripts in
excess of <VAR>NLAYS3D+1</VAR> may well point to garbage.   A new file
attribute <STRONG>VGTOP3D</STRONG> is used to store the  MODEL-TOP for
the sigma coord types.  For sigma-P coordinates,  <VAR>VGTOP3D</VAR> is
given in Pascals; for sigma-Z, it is in meters.
<P> 
 
Diagrams showing the relationship of the grid and its layers to the
header attributes <VAR>VGLVS3D</VAR>, etc., are available in 
<A HREF = "3D.ps">Postscript</A>, 
<A HREF = "3D.xbm">X bitmap</A>,
<A HREF = "3D.jpg">JPEG</A>, and
<A HREF = "3D.gif">GIF</A> image formats.  Note that Layer 1 is the 
bottom layer in the modeling grid.
<P> 

<VAR>VGTYP3D&nbsp;=&nbsp;IMISS</VAR> is used when there is only one
layer, and also when the  vertical coordinate values
<VAR>VGLVS3D(MXLAYS3+1)</VAR> are irrelevant (e.g., if  the vertical
coordinate value for the levels is spatially or temporally  varying, in
which case the values should be store as variables either  in the same
file or in an appropriate vertical-geometry file.  In principle,  layer
K goes from <VAR>VGLVS3D(K)</VAR> to <VAR>VGLVS3D(K+1)</VAR>.
<VAR>VGTOP3D</VAR> is the  &quot;top of the model&quot; parameter used
for sigma types of coordinates  (where generally the equation for sigma
is of the form 
<PRE>
   sigma = ( X - X_top ) / ( X_bottom -X_top ).
</PRE>
For other types of coordinate, <VAR>VGTOP3D</VAR> is unused, and should
be set to <VAR>BADVAL3</VAR>.
<P> 

Note that <STRONG> FOO&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;AMISS3</STRONG> is a safe and
machine  independent test to determine whether <VAR>FOO</VAR> has been
set to <VAR>BADVAL3</VAR>.
