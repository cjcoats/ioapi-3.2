    The intent is to extend the Models-3/EDSS I/O&nbsp;API by adding a
    new data type (and therefore a new file type), the
    <STRONG><EM>geospatial-element cell complex (GECC) </EM></STRONG>
    data type, that supports both geospatial and finite-element data in
    a way upwardly compatible with the existing API and its library. 
    This extension significantly generalizes the geospatial metadata
    structure espoused by Butler <EM>et&nbsp;al</EM>, along lines
    discussed by John&nbsp;Ambrosiano and the author since 1996.  The
    data structures involved are based upon foundational twentieth
    century work on the classification of geometric structure by
    topologists and geometers Whitney, Whitehead, Kervaire, Milnor, and
    Adams, and more recently Quillen and Sullivan, who proved that the
    data structures proposed are both necessary and sufficient to deal
    with problems of three dimensional geometric structure (and that
    the obvious generalization is adequate through six dimensions;
    Sullivan and Quillen give an explicit classification of its
    indeterminacy for problems of seven or greater dimensions).
    <P>

    GECC files have three sections:
    <UL>
         <LI>  A <STRONG>header</STRONG>, like current  I/O&nbsp;API
               file headers;
         <LI>  A <STRONG>geometry specification</STRONG>, which
               specifies the geometric/topological structure and its
               georegistration;
         <LI>  A set of <STRONG>variables</STRONG>, which may be optionally
               time-stepped, and which live on a specified dimensional
               part of the geometry (i.e., each variable
               &quot;lives&quot; either on the vertices, the edges, the
               faces, or the 3-cells of the geometry.
    </UL>
    There are new data structures introduced to allow for access,
    storage, and retrieval of these geometric specifications, as well
    as new API-methods <CODE>GEOPEN3()</CODE> (if necessary, depending
    upon decisions that need to be made <A HREF = "#issues">(below)</A>)
    to open or create GECC files, <CODE>GEDESC3()</CODE> to retrieve a
    file's geometric specification, and various utility methods to
    perform other geometry-related tasks.  Existing I/O&nbsp;API
    routines  <CODE>READ3()</CODE>, <CODE>WRITE3()</CODE>,
    <CODE>INTERP3()</CODE>, and <CODE>DDTVAR3()</CODE> would be
    extended for GECC-file data access, storage, and retrieval. The
    resulting API will be callable from at least Fortran 77 and 90, C,
    and C++.  GECC-files offer direct support for polygon-based data
    such as is found in emissions (e.g., area sources) and in
    GIS-related coverages, without biasing the representation by
    artificial triangulation or reticulation, and without the extra
    storage overhead which would also ensue.
    <P>
    
    One aspect that deserves attention is dealing with the existing
    built-in <STRONG>I/O&nbsp;API layer structure</STRONG>:  unless
    this is over-ridden, the geometry will automatically have a layer
    structure given by the built-in layer structure.  One could argue
    that it would be simpler to ignore the 3-dimensional-cell
    description aspect and use purely the layer structure to extend the
    geometry to the vertical dimension.  This would be sufficient for
    the vast majority of GIS-related geospatial data applications;
    however, it would fail to support data with irregular or only
    partially-layered vertical structures (like ocean models or
    irregular three-dimensional geological structures for ground water
    modeling) which would be significant at a later date.  The
    recommendation is to do the fully three-dimensional cell-complex
    geometry descriptions <EM>and</EM> to support the I/O&nbsp;API
    layer structure, with the interpretation that when the number of
    layers is nontrivial and the number of higher-dimensional cells
    is zero (no 3-cells, etc.), then the generic I/O&nbsp;API layer
    structure is responsible for the vertical structure (giving
    &quot;prismic geometry&quot; for which all horizontal
    cross-sections are identical as a result). This would be useful,
    for example, for emissions point-source plume rise for which there
    is a vertical structure, but only at the vertices (there being no
    edges, faces, nor 3-cells).  The one ambiguous interpretation
    problem is dealing with the case of a fully three-dimensional
    cell complex that also has a nontrivial vertical layer structure. 
    Options are to:
    <UL>
        <LI>  prohibit it within the I/O&nbsp;API code itself; 
        <LI>  forbid it as a matter of coding standards; or
        <LI>  allow it, on the chance that someone will find
              a useful reason for it as a case of data-structure abuse.

    <A NAME="gecc">Geospatial Cell Complexes</A>
</H2>

    A <STRONG>Geospatial Element Cell Complex</STRONG> is a
    geometric data structure with the following components and
    relationships:
    <UL>
        <LI>  A set of <STRONG>nodes</STRONG> (or vertices), that 
              have specified positions.  Topologists will frequently
              call this set the <STRONG>0-skeleton</STRONG>.
        <LI>  A set of <STRONG>edges</STRONG> (which are line segments).
              Topologists will frequently call this set the
              <STRONG>1-skeleton</STRONG>.
        <LI>  A set of <STRONG>faces</STRONG> (which are polygons).
              Topologists will frequently call this set the
              <STRONG>2-skeleton</STRONG>.
       <LI>  A set of <STRONG>cells</STRONG> (which are 3-dimensional
              polyhedral solids). Topologists will frequently call this
              set the <STRONG>3-skeleton</STRONG>.
        <LI>  An <STRONG>edge::node boundary relation</STRONG> that
              specifies the beginning and ending nodes for each
              edge.
        <LI>  A <STRONG>face::edge boundary relation</STRONG> that
              specifies the (signed) set of edges which constitute
              the boundary of each face.
        <LI>  An <STRONG>cell::face boundary relation</STRONG> that
              specifies the (signed) set of faces which constitute
              the boundary of each cell.
    </UL>
    The <STRONG>dimension</STRONG> of a GECC is given by the smallest
    nonempty skeleton:  0-dimensional if only the node-set is nonempty,
    1-dimensional if the edge-set (and therefore the node-set) is
    nonempty. etc.  In environmental modeling, we need to describe 
    variables in terms of how the modeling algorithms interpret them:
    some variables are naturally thought of as being a property of the
    nodes; others of the edges, faces, or cells.  In the current air
    quality models, for example, we think of concentrations as being
    cell-means (and so associated with the 3-skeleton), whereas we think
    of wind fields as being associated with corners (and so associated
    with the 0-skeleton).  In emissions, area and biogenic sources will
    be associated with county-polygons, i.e., the 2-skeleton, etc.
    <P>

    All edges, faces, and cells are <STRONG>oriented</STRONG>, as is
    required to do line, surface, and volume integrals (and to make the
    relationships among them correct -- Green's, Stokes', Gauss'
    Theorems, etc.).  This orientedness shows up in the boundary
    relations:
    <UL>
        <LI>  An edge has a starting node and an ending node. The
              boundary relation can be represented as a mapping of
              the set of edges into ordered pairs&nbsp;
              <STRONG><CODE>&lt;starting-node,ending-node&gt;</CODE></STRONG>
              &nbsp;of nodes.  
              <P>
        <LI>  A face has a &quot;top&quot; and a &quot;bottom&quot;
              as its specification of orientation, and it has some
              finite set of edges.  The face and an edge in  its
              boundary have <EM>matching orientations</EM> if the edge
              is oriented in the counterclockwise direction relative to
              the interior of the face when viewed from the top side of
              the face, and <EM>reverse orientations</EM> otherwise. 
              The boundary relation can be represented as (sparse)
              incidence matrix, with rows subscripted by faces, columns
              subscripted by edges, with positive values for boundary
              edges with orientations matching  the face, negative
              values for reversed orientation, and zeros for edges
              not on the boundaries of the respective faces.
              <P>
        <LI>  A cell has a <EM>positive orientation</EM> if it has
              a right handed coordinate system with respect to the
              underlying map projection Cartesian coordinate system,
              and <EM>negative orientation </EM> otherwise.  The
              boundary relation can be represented as (sparse)
              incidence matrix, with rows subscripted by cells, columns
              subscripted by faces, with positive values for boundary
              faces with matching orientations, negative values for
              reverse orientation, etc., much as for faces and edges.
              <P>
    </UL>
    Many of the applications anticipated in atmosphere-related
    environmental modeling will profit from a natural I/O&nbsp;API
    extension -- <STRONG>layered GECC's</STRONG>, for which the set
    of cells (and possibly the sets of faces or edges) is empty, and
    one is trying to model the Cartesian product structure of some
    lower-dimensional cell complex with a layered atmospheric
    structure.  The most obvious application of this is in modeling
    point source plume rise, in which there is a natural 0-dimensional
    cell complex of point sources, and a variable (<VAR>plume
    fraction</VAR>) that &quot;lives&quot; on the atmospheric layer
    structure above the point sources.  Arguably, one might improve
    plume-in-grid modeling by having either a 1-dimensional cell
    complex that is the union of the various plume-centerlines, a
    vertically layered atmospheric structure, and a Gaussian horizontal
    structure, or a two-dimensional horizontal GECC structure with a
    vertically layered atmospheric structure.  Both cases require at
    least <EM>time-varying geometry</EM> (with time-independent
    topology), as discussed <A HREF = "#issues">in the section on
    issues, below</A>.
    <P>

    There are <STRONG>additional geometric-utility routines</STRONG>
    that might be desirable, including routines for at least the
    following tasks:
    <UL>
        <LI>  Find the <STRONG>Centroids, areas, volumes..</STRONG>
              of cells/faces/edges.
              <P>
        <LI>  Find the <STRONG>intersection-complex</STRONG> of a pair
              of GECCs or of a GECC and a regualr grid.
              <P>
        <LI>  Find the <STRONG>common-boundary</STRONG> sub-complex
              for a pair of neighboring cells/faces/edges.
              <P>
        <LI>  Construct the Poincare dual complex to a particular
              GECC.  (This is a homeomorphic complex, with one node
              for each cell, one edge for each face, one face for each
              edge, and one cell for each node.  Note that in the usual
              2-D gridded situation, the &quot;dot-point grid&quot; is
              the Poincare dual of the &quot;cross-point grid&quot;)

        <LI>  How much flexibility do we give to the variables?
              We can potentially allow individual variables to be
              time-stepped or time-independent... do we allow
              time-stepped variables to have different time steps?
              <P>
              <EM>(Almost certainly this would cause extra netCDF
              fill-overhead and probably break the internal paradigm
              of some of our visualization tools; just the choice of
              &quot;this is time independent&quot; versus &quot;this
              uses the file's time step&quot; on a variable-by-variable
              basis would be relatively clean to implement and use,
              would not incur extra netCDF overhead, and not break vis
              tools.)</EM>
              <P>

        <LI>  Given the time-stepping flexibility above, do we make the
              node-position variables user-level variables, or do we
              insist that they be part of the geometry data structure,
              and so specified during the
              <STRONG><CODE>&nbsp;GEOPEN3()&nbsp;</CODE></STRONG> call?
              <P>
              <EM>I favor the choice of allowing individual variables
              to be either time-stepped with the file-specified time
              step, or time-independent:  this deals cleanly with the
              situation of cleanly allowing 2-dimensional GECCs to
              require only two node-position variables, whereas
              3-dimensional GECCs need three.  It also cleanly handles
              the question: &quot;What are the units for the node
              position variables&quot;.  At the same time, it allows
              both easy implementation and additional flexibility which
              may prove useful to support additional time-independent
              attributes of GECCs.</EM>
              <P>

        <LI>  Do we need also to support some version of <STRONG>time
              varying geometry</STRONG>?  If so, there are two options,
              a simpler and weaker notion that is much easier to deal
              with from both the I/O&nbsp;API implementation and the
              user/modeler points of  view, and a more-complex
              alternative notion:
              <BLOCKQUOTE> 
                  <STRONG>Time-independent topology</STRONG> where only
                  the (node) positions change, but the sets of nodes,
                  faces, edges, and cells, and the boundary relations
                  among them are time-independent.  For this case,
                  <STRONG><CODE>INTERP3()</CODE></STRONG> make sense as
                  an I/O&nbsp;API call.  This choice can be implemented
                  by simply allowing the node-position variables to be
                  either time-stepped or time independent, as the user
                  selects at file-creation time.
                  <P>
                  <STRONG>Time-dependent topology</STRONG> in which
                  the entire geometry can change from time step to
                  time step (and for which the modeler reading data
                  must first make a geometry inquiry, then allocate
                  appropriate buffers, and finally read data into
                  them.  The write-operation also requires a separate
                  call, for which both the geometry and the data are
                  arguments.  Note that
                  <STRONG><CODE>INTERP3()</CODE></STRONG> does not make
                  sense as an I/O&nbsp;API call in this case, because
                  there is no topology on which to define it.
                  <P>
                  <EM>I recommend that we not implement this option at
                  first; if we later decide that it is necessary, then
                  we should implement it as an additional and different
                  file type (Time  Stepped Cell Complex, or TSCC
                  files?), using similar data structures and employing
