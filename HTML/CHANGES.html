<A NAME = "taskp">OpenMP Task-Parallel Extensions</A>
</H2>

    For Version&nbsp;2, the I/O&nbsp;API was substantially re-written
    to support thread-safe task-parallel use in modeling.  In general,
    data access operations may be called at the same time, provided that
    they do not access the same variable from the same file.  In
    particular, because <CODE><A HREF = "INTERP3.html" >INTERP3()</A></CODE> 
    and <CODE><A HREF = "DDTVAR3.html">DDTVAR3()</A></CODE> 
    always do substantial linear-algebra computations (linear
    interpolation and re-scaled differencing, respectively), while
    they only occasionally do actual I/O (because the manage
    behind-the-scenes double-buffering for the interpolation buffers),
    substantial gains in parallel efficiency may be obtained by using
    the OpenMP <CODE>PARALLEL SECTIONS</CODE> facility to perform
    multiple <CODE>INTERP3()</CODE>'s in task-parallel. Additionally,
    the (relatively fine-grained) KF-file access functions <CODE>
    <A HREF = "KFOPEN.html" >KFOPEN()</A>, 
    <A HREF = "KFINDX.html" >KFINDX()</A>
    <A HREF = "KFREAD.html" >KFREAD()</A>
    <A HREF = "KFWRITE.html" >KFWRITE()</A> </CODE> may be called 
    in parallel even acting on the same variable(s) of the same file(s).
    <P>

</H2>

    As part of the MCNC
    <A HREF = "http://www.baronams.com:/projects/ppar/index.html">Practical
    Parallel Project</A>, MCNC has developed an extended
    <STRONG><A HREF = "BUFFERED.html">Model-Coupling Mode</A></STRONG> 
    for the I/O&nbsp;API.  This mode, implemented using 
    <A HREF = "http://www.epm.ornl.gov:80/pvm/">PVM&nbsp;3.4</A> 
    mailboxes, allows the user to specify in
    the run-script whether &quot;file&quot; means a physical file on
    disk or a PVM mailbox-based communications channel (a
    <STRONG>virtual file</STRONG>), on the basis of the value of the 
    file's <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html">logical name</A>.  For models 
    exchanging data via virtual files of the I/O&nbsp;API's coupling mode, 
    the I/O&nbsp;API schedules the various processes on the basis of data 
    availability:
    <UL>
        <LI>  <CODE>OPEN3()</CODE> calls for read-access to virtual
              files that haven't yet been opened for write access by
              some other process put the caller to sleep until the 
              file is opened; and
              <P>
         <LI>  <CODE>READ3()</CODE>, <CODE>INTERP3()</CODE>, or
              <CODE>DDTVAR3()</CODE> calls for virtual-file data which 
              has not yet been written put the reading process to sleep 
              until the data arrives, at which point the reader is 
              awakened and given the data it requested.  
    </UL>
    There are two requirements on the modeler: 
    <UL>
        <LI>  structuring reads and writes so as to avoid deadlocks 
              (two or more models, each asleep while waiting for input 
              from the other); and 
        <LI>  providing enough feedbacks to prevent one process from
              &quot;racing ahead&quot; of the others.  In a one-way
              coupled system, this may mean the introduction of
              artificial <VAR>synchronization files</VAR> which exist
              solely to provide these feedbacks.
    </UL>
    <P>
    This has several advantages from the model-engineering point of
    view:
    <UL>  
        <LI>  The same programs work unchanged both in standalone mode
              (reading input from files and writing output to files)
              and in coupled-model mode (reading and writing selected
              inputs or outputs to/from PVM mailboxes).
               
        <LI>  Readers and writers do not need to know about each other
              in detail.  In particular, any reader only needs to know 
              that <EM>some</EM> writer will put the variables it needs
              into the mailbox.  Writers don't care whether readers
              even exist or not.
              
        <LI>  One writer can supply multiple readers without special
              programming (and without needing to know who they are).
              For example, in a coupled system with the MM5/MCIP
              meteorology model, the SMOKE emissions model, and the 
              MAQSIP air quality model, MM5 produces 5 time-stepped
              output &quot;virtual files&quot;, some variables of two
              of which are read by SMOKE and all of which are read by
              MAQSIP; and SMOKE produces one output &quot;virtual
              files&quot; read by MAQSIP.  MAQSIP produces a 
              &quot;synchronization file&quot; read by MM5/MCIP and
              used to keep MM5/MCIP from running ahead and exhausting
              available mailbox-buffer space.
              
        <LI>  Since data is tagged by variable-name, simulation date, 
              and time, the system is not subject to data scrambling
              because of implicit programming assumptions about the
              data ordering in the way that stream-like communications
              channels are.

</H2>
        
    In order to support the needs of surface-water, lake and estuary,
    and bay modeling, at the request of EPA-AREAL we have added two
    routines to the I/O&nbsp;API which will access an entire time
    step sequence of data in a single operation (&quot;read or write
    <VAR>N</VAR> time steps of data starting at date and time 
    <VAR>D:T</VAR> with step <VAR>DT</VAR> for variable <VAR>V</VAR> 
    to/from file <VAR>F</VAR>&quot;).  The new routines are
    <CODE><A HREF = "READ4D.html">READ4D()</A></CODE> and 
    <CODE><A HREF = "WRITE4D.html">WRITE4D()</A></CODE>, and 
    very much resemble <CODE>READ3()</CODE> and
    <CODE>WRITE3()</CODE>, except for the specification of an
    entire time step sequence as arguments, the restriction to
    single-variable operations (<CODE>ALLVAR3</CODE> is
    <STRONG>not</STRONG> supported for these) and file types
    <CODE><A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#custom">CUSTOM3</A></CODE>,

    For I/O&nbsp;API version&nbsp;2, conditional compilation directives 
    were modified to make it easier to port the I/O&nbsp;API 
    to other platforms.  Four issues are prominent:
    <UL>  
        <LI>  Name mangling (trailing underscores) conventions
        <LI>  CHARACTER string-passing conventions;
        <LI>  Native length for REAL, INTEGER, and DOUBLE;
        <LI>  Dynamic memory allocation mechanism, whether via 
              Cray-pointers and <VAR>MALLOC</VAR> or by automatic
              arrays (as in <VAR>g77</VAR> and F-90).
    </UL>
    Preprocessor definitions and conditional compilation directives
    recognizing many of these have been provided in the code, as 
    follows:
    <UL>  
        <LI>  FLDMN=1 specifies Feldmann-style name mangling (trailing 
              underscore) and  CHARACTER string-passing (Pass strings
              as C <VAR>char *</VAR> arguments, and add extra 
              &quot;hidden&quot; <VAR>int</VAR> value arguments for
              string-length at the end of arg-lists, in the same order
              as the string-arguments) conventions;
        <LI>  REAL8=1 specifies that Fortran REAL has the same type
              as C <VAR>double</VAR>, whereas REAL8=4 specifies the
              correspondence with C <VAR>float</VAR>.
        <LI>  AUTO_ARRAYS=1 specifies availability of off-the-stack
              allocation for local arrays.
    </UL>
    This provides support for at least the following additional platforms 
    and compilers:
    <UL>  
        <LI>  gcc/g77 (FLDMN=1, REAL8=0, and AUTO_ARRAYS=1) on a wide
              variety of platforms (including gcc/g77 on Win32 via the
              Cygnus port).
        <LI>  Win32 (Windows&nbsp;3.1/win32s, Windows&nbsp;95, and 
              Windows&nbsp;NT/x86) using either the Digital or the
              Absoft Fortran-90 compilers and the Microsoft C compiler
              (for Absoft and DVF5, this requires that the Fortran 
              pre-processing be done in advance on a UNIX system;  
              FLDMN=1, REAL8=0, and AUTO_ARRAYS=1 work for many of these
              combinations if you specify <VAR>UNIX</VAR> calling
              conventions; hard-coded support has also been added for
              DVF6 using the so-called Microsoft <VAR>STDCALL</VAR>
              calling conventions.);
        <LI>  Windows&nbsp;NT/Alpha using the Digital compilers (also
              requires Fortran pre-processing n advance; FLDMN=1,
              REAL8=0, and AUTO_ARRAYS=1);
        <LI>  &lt;suggestions? <A HREF = "mailto:cjcoats@email.unc.edu">

</H2>

    The Kain-Fritsch prameterization for convective clouds (as found
    in the MM5 and Eta meteorological models, and as adapted for air
    quality models by McHenry) generates data which does not fit the
    basic I/O&nbsp;API model of data which always occurs on a regular
    time step sequence
    [&lt;date&gt;:&lt;time&gt;:&lt;time-step&gt;:&lt;record-count&gt;]
    for all the cells in an entire array.  Instead, convective cloud 
    events happen on a cell-by-cell basis, each event having its own
    starting location [&lt;column&gt;,&lt;row&gt;] on a grid, as well
    as its own
    [&lt;starting-date&gt;:&lt;starting-time&gt;:&lt;duration&gt;]
    which define its lifetime.  We have constructed an additional
    file type <CODE><A HREF="DATATYPES.html#kfevnt">KFEVNT3</A></CODE> 
    with data structures appropriate for this data, together with 
    additional operations

    A number of changes are being made in modeling conventions for the

    CHARACTER*16 buffers).  This makes the API more robust 
    (you no longer need to pad to exactly length-16), as well
    as friendlier (you can use immediate-mode strings -- e.g. 
    use 'SO4' as a variable-name).
<P>    

    For metadata tracking (suggested by Becky Bagdasarian):  the I/O API 
    will look for <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> 
    <STRONG>environment variable &quot;EXECUTION_ID&quot;</STRONG> </A>, 
    to be stored in file headers to identify the exact program execution 
    which produced the file.  For files opened for writing, it will
    record the execution-ID (as a CHARACTER*80 string in the file header,
    and will report it appropriately.  It can be retrieved by getting
    the <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> file description </A> using
    routine <A HREF = "DESC3.html"> <VAR>DESC3()</VAR> </A> and then
    examining <VAR>EXECN3D</VAR>.
<P>        

    We introduce a new <STRONG>timestep-structure 
    <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#timestruct"> 
    &quot;circular-buffer&quot; </A> </STRONG> (or &quot;restart&quot;)
    for files.  The circular-buffer time step structure allows you
    to minimize the disk space consumed while at the same time 
    ensuring that enough data is stored to disk to allow you to
    restart a computation.  It is defined as follows:
    <UL>
        <LI>  For circular-buffer files, the 
              <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#fdesc"> header-timestep 
              attribute <STRONG>TSTEP3D</STRONG> </A>  is negative, and 
              is the  additive inverse of the actual time-step.
        <LI>  The files keep two active time steps -- the &quot;even&quot;
              and the &quot;odd&quot; time step.
    </UL>
    
<P>        

    We introduce <A HREF = "BUFFERED.html"> 
    <STRONG>&quot;BUFFERED&quot;</STRONG>  </A> virtual files to provide
    a mechanism that is safer and more robust than COMMON blocks for 
    sharing data among modules within the same program.  These 
    &quot;files&quot; are actually an <EM>in-memory</EM> mechanism for 
    sharing data between modules in the same program; they are created 
    and read from and written to just as ordinary files are.  Only two 
    active time steps are kept in memory (as two active disk records
    are kept for circular-buffer files, above); memory allocation,
    etc., is handled behind the scenes by the I/O API when these 
    virtual files are created.
<P>        

    You cause a file with say<A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical name </A> 
    FOO to be BUFFERED by the way you assign the logical name:  
    <VAR>setenv FOO BUFFERED</VAR> instead of 
    <VAR>setenv FOO <VAR>&lt;file path name&gt;</VAR> </VAR>.  Since
    <A HREF = "READ3.html"> READ3() </A> and 
    <A HREF = "INTERP3.html"> INTERP3() </A> check the date and time
    associated with the data they retrieve, the I/O API will catch and
    report instances when you attempt to use data in one module before
    it has been generated in another (unlike COMMON blocks, which will
    blithely let you attempt to use variables that haven't been set yet).
    Since the decision as to whether a file is BUFFERED or is a real
    disk-file is made at program-launch, on the basis of <VAR>setenv</VAR>s
    in the script, the calling program doesn't know (nor need to know) 
    whether a file is BUFFERED or not.  This provides the opportunity to
    save -- at will -- a program's intermediate values to disk for 
    further analysis.

    For files opened "unknown", the file may or may not exist; the

    If the file type is GRIDDED, BOUNDARY, or CUSTOM, then the

    and the semantics is that .TRUE. is returned iff the indicated

        segment has a 1-line header (which by convention provides
        titles for the columns in the data records), a sequence 
        of data records, and a terminal record with name field blank
        ( i.e.  <CODE>'   '</CODE>).  The first segment is the 
        <STRONG>coordinate system description segment</STRONG> 
        and consists  of text records giving coordinate-system name and 
        descriptive parameters P_ALP, P_BET, P_GAM, XCENT, and YCENT.  
        The second segment is the <STRONG>grid-description segment</STRONG>, and 
        consists of text records giving grid name, related 
        coordinate-system name and descriptive parameters 
        XORIG, YORIG, XCELL, YCELL, NCOLS, NROWS, and NTHIK.  
        Each data record is list-formatted (i.e., items are separated 
        by either blanks or commas, where names are quoted strings, and 
        consists of three lines, as appropriate:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>    
    COORD-NAME
    P_ALP, P_BET, P_GAM
    XCENT, YCENT
    
        or
    
    GRID-NAME
    COORD-NAME, XORIG, YORIG, XCELL, YCELL
    NCOLS, NROWS, NTHIK
</PRE>
    There are at most 32 coordinate systems and 256 grids listed in 
    one of these files.  These files are small enough to be archived
    easily with a study, and have a sufficiently simple format that new
    ones can easily be constructed &quot;by hand.&quot;
<P>         

    Logical function <A HREF = "DSCGRID.html"> <STRONG>DSCGRID()
    </STRONG> </A> manages access to GRIDDESC (in fact, serves as an
    operational definition of the GRIDDESC file format), and gets grid 
    and  coordinate system descriptive parameters  COORDNAME, COORDTYPE, 
    P_ALP, P_BET,  P_GAM, XCENT, YCENT, XORIG, YORIG, XCELL, YCELL, 
    NCOLS, NROWS, and NTHIK for the specified grid name.  Returns 
    TRUE iff the requested grid is found in the GRIDDESC file.   
    LOGICAL ENTRY <STRONG>DSCOORD()</STRONG> of DSCGRID() gets 
    coordinate-system descriptive  parameters P_ALP, P_BET, P_GAM, 
    XCENT, and YCENT for the specified coordinate system name 
    (also returning TRUE iff the coordinate system is found in 
    the GRIDDESC file).
