<H1>    Environment Variables for the I/O&nbsp;API </H1>

<H2>Standard I/O&nbsp;API environment variables</H2>

The following are standard environment variables supported or used by
the I/O&nbsp;API.  These should be set using <VAR>setenv</VAR>, for
example, if you are using <VAR>csh</VAR>). Note  that for environment
variables with multi-word values (i.e., values containing blanks), you
will need to quote the value in order for <VAR>setenv</VAR> to handle it
correctly&mdash;for example:
    <PRE>
        setenv  EXECUTION_ID  'This run will pling the Inghams'
        setenv  MYLIST        '1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7'
    </PRE>

<UL>
    <LI>  <STRONG>LOGFILE</STRONG>  is the physical pathname for
          the program log.   If this logical name is present, the
          indicated file  is opened  for output; otherwise, Fortran
          standard output to UNIT 6 for the log is assumed.  This log
          file is used throughout the I/O&nbsp;API, also, its unit
          number is returned by <A HREF = "INIT3.html"> INIT3() </A>.
          <P>
          This facility was provided for use with (now-obsolete)
          devices like CalComp plotters that hijack <CODE>STDOUT</CODE>.
          <P>

    <LI>  <STRONG>SCENFILE</STRONG> is the physical pathname for the
          scenario description file.  If present, the contents of this
          file will be  copied into the &quot;update description&quot;
          of files  opened for writing during this program execution.
          The file  may have up to
          <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#parms"><CODE>MXDESC3=60</CODE></A>
          lines of length at most
          <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#parms"> <CODE>MXDLIN3=80.</CODE></A>
          <P>

    <LI>  <STRONG>GRIDDESC</STRONG> is the logical name for the ASCII
          <A HREF = "GRIDS.html#horiz">horizontal coordinate and grid
          description</A> files used by utility  routines
          <A HREF = "DSCGRID.html"><CODE>DSCGRID()</CODE> and
          <CODE>DSCOORD()</CODE>.</A>

    <LI>  <STRONG>EXECUTION_ID</STRONG> is provided for use in
          tracking the system ID of the current execution, and if
          present, it is  copied into the &quot;execution
          ID&quot; field of files  opened for writing during this
          program execution.   It is a character string of length at
          most  <A HREF = "INCLUDE.html#parms"><CODE>MXDLIN3=80.</CODE></A>
          with default value
          <CODE>CMISS3=&quot;????????????????&quot;</CODE>
          <P>

    <LI>  <STRONG>IOAPI_ISPH</STRONG> (<CODE>REAL*8</CODE> value) tells
          the system which GCTP-sphere to use (the default is the GRS
          1980 geodetic spheroid):  see <CODE>STDSPHERES</CODE>
          and  <CODE>SPHERENAMES</CODE> in
          <A HREF="MODGCTP.html"><CODE>MODULE&nbsp;MODGCTP</CODE></A>
          and routines <A HREF="SETSPHERE.html"><CODE>SETSPHERE,
          INITSPHERES,</CODE> and <CODE>SPHEREDAT</CODE></A>,  This
          environment variable is also used by a number of
          <VAR>m3tools</VAR> programs that call these routines.
          <P>

    <LI>  <STRONG>IOAPI_CHECK_HEADERS</STRONG> (<CODE>LOGICAL&nbsp;Y/N</CODE>)
          controls whether consistency and validity checks are
          turned on for files being created (value begins with 'Y' or
          'y'), or not. The default value is 'N', indicating that the
          check will not take place.
          <P>

    <LI>  <STRONG>IOAPI_OFFSET_64</STRONG> (<CODE>LOGICAL&nbsp;Y/N</CODE>)
          controls a netCDF limitation: by default, netCDF cannot
          handle output time steps larger than 2 GB.  If this is turned
          on (<CODE>setenv&nbsp;IOAPI_OFFSET_64&nbsp;YES</CODE>), then
          netCDF is told to create files that can have timesteps larger
          than 2 GB.   Note that <CODE>MXVARS3=2048</CODE> variables on
          a 100&times;100&times;25 grid (or 21 variables on a
          1000&times;1000&times;25 grid) occupies slightly less than
          2GB, so we're talking "quite large" model runs in order to
          need this...).  <BR>
          NetCDF still has a 2GB per variable per time step limitation,
          by the way&mdash;though it is worth noting that for your model
          to use single arrays larger than 2GB, you will have to compile
          it with the &quot;64-bit medium memory model&quot;, which is
          <EM>not</EM> the default for the Intel, GNU, or Portland Group
          compilers.
          <P>

    <LI>  <STRONG>IOAPI_LOG_WRITE</STRONG> (<CODE>LOGICAL&nbsp;Y/N</CODE>)
          controls whether a log message is written for each successful
          WRITE3() operation (messages are always written for failures).
          The default value is 'Y', indicating that the log messages
          will be generated.
          <P>

    <LI>  <STRONG>IOAPI_KEEP_NSTEPS</STRONG> (<CODE>INTEGER</CODE> value
          with default 2) controls how many time steps of data will be
          kept in active PVM mailboxes for
          <A HREF="BUFFERED.html#pvm">I/O&nbsp;API coupling-mode virtual
          files</A>
          <P>

    <LI>  <STRONG>PROMPTFLAG</STRONG> (<CODE>LOGICAL&nbsp;Y/N</CODE>,
          with default <CODE>N</CODE>) controls whether
          routines <A HREF = "GETDBLE.html">GETDBLE()</A>,
          <A HREF = "GETMENU.html">GETMENU()</A>,
          <A HREF = "GETNUM.html">GETNUM()</A>,
          <A HREF = "GETREAL.html">GETREAL()</A>,
          <A HREF = "GETSTR.html">GETSTR()</A>,
          <A HREF = "GETYN.html">GETYN()</A>,
          <A HREF = "PROMPTFFILE.html">PROMPTFFILE()</A>, and
          <A HREF = "PROMPTMFILE.html">PROMPTMFILE()</A>, prompt the user for
          the value requested, or not.  Setting PROMPTFLAG to &quot;N&quot;
          can be used, in conjunction with the selection of &quot;smart&quot;
          defaults within programs, to make it easier to write scripts for
          running various programs.
          <P>
</UL>
<P>

The following environment variables are for <STRONG>I/O&nbsp;API-3.2 or
later only</STRONG>:
<UL>

    <LI>  <STRONG>IOAPI_CFMETA</STRONG>
          controls whether CF compliant metadata will be written
          to the headers of newly-created files.
          <P>

    <LI>  <STRONG>IOAPI_CMAQMETA</STRONG> (<CODE>LOGICAL&nbsp;Y/N</CODE>,
          with default <CODE>N</CODE>)
          controls whether CF compliant metadata will be written
          to the headers of newly-created files.
          <P>

    <LI>  <STRONG>IOAPI_CMAQMETA</STRONG> (<CODE>LOGICAL&nbsp;Y/N</CODE>,
          with default <CODE>N</CODE>)
          controls whether CMAQ-standard metadata will be written
          to the headers of newly-created files.
          <P>

    <LI>  <STRONG>IOAPI_SMOKEMETA</STRONG> (<CODE>LOGICAL&nbsp;Y/N</CODE>,
          with default <CODE>N</CODE>)
          controls whether SMOKE-standard metadata will be written
          to the headers of newly-created files.
          <P>
</UL>
<P>

<H2>OpenMP Parallel Control</H2>

Generally, all OpenMP parallel programs use environment variable
<STRONG><CODE>OMP_NUM_THREADS</CODE></STRONG> to control how many
parallel threads/processors are used for program execution.  In
particular, this applies to &quot;m3tools&quot; programs <CODE>M3AGMASK,
M3AGMAX, M3COMBO, M3TPROC</CODE> and <CODE>VERTINTEGRAL</CODE> for
I/O&nbsp;API version&nbsp;3.1 later than Nov.&nbsp;21, 2013, and
programs built with I/O&nbsp;API routines <CODE>BILIN()</CODE>,
<CODE>BMATVEC()</CODE>,  <CODE>DMATVEC</CODE>,  <CODE>CBARNES1()</CODE>,
and  <CODE>CBARNESN()</CODE> using I/O&nbsp;API versions later than
Sept.&nbsp;12, 2014.
<P>

<H2>I/O&nbsp;API Environment-Variable Routines</H2>

For single-valued environment variables of various types.
<A HREF = "ENVDBLE.html"><CODE>ENVDBLE()</CODE></A>,
<A HREF = "ENVINT.html"><CODE>ENVINT()</CODE></A>,
<A HREF = "ENVREAL.html"><CODE>ENVREAL()</CODE></A> ,
<A HREF = "ENVSTR.html"><CODE>ENVSTR()</CODE></A>,
and <A HREF = "ENVYN.html"><CODE>ENVYN()</CODE></A> can be used from programs to find
values of types <CODE>DOUBLE PRECISION, INTEGER, REAL, CHARACTER</CODE>
string, or <CODE>LOGICAL</CODE>; <A HREF = "ENVGETS.html"><CODE>ENVGET()</CODE></A>
is a generic routine for single-value environment variables of any of these types.
<A HREF="LISTS.html">For environment variables whose values are
comma-delimited lists</A> <CODE>INTLIST(), REALLIST(),</CODE>, and
<CODE>STRLIST()</CODE> are type-specific for lists of  types
<CODE>INTEGER, REAL,</CODE> or <CODE>CHARACTER</CODE> string;
<CODE>ENVLIST()</CODE> is the generic. All of thes routines  log the
value retrieved, convert it to the indicated type, and return it to  the
caller.
<P>

Routine <A HREF = "NAMEVAL.html"><CODE>NAMEVAL()</CODE></A>, which
performs a similar function for <CODE>CHARACTER</CODE> STRINGs, but does
not log  the transaction, is used internally by the I/O&nbsp;API; this
should <EM>not</EM> be used by modeling codes, for log-integrity
reasons. <P>

Routine <A HREF = "SETENV.html"><CODE>SETENVVAR()</CODE></A> can be used
to set environment variables for the currently-executing program.
