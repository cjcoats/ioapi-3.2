<H1>    FILES, LOGICAL NAMES AND PHYSICAL NAMES  </H1>
        
In dealing with the files, programs using the I/O API refer to
files by <STRONG>logical names</STRONG>, instead of forcing the 
programmer and program-user to deal with hard-coded file names or
hard-coded unit numbers.  One of the consequences of this is that 
multiple copies of a program executing at the same time do not 
interfere with each other, since each execution has its own 
separate &quot;space&quot; for environment variables.  As a 
modeler, you can define your own logical names as properties 
of a program (or even prompt the user for his own preferred 
logical names at run time) and then at run-time connect up the 
logical names to any &quot;real&quot; file name you want to, 
using the UNIX <VAR>csh setenv</VAR> command.  For programming 
purposes, the significant facts are that names should not contain 
blanks (except at the end:  <VAR>'BAR  '</VAR> is OK; 
<VAR>'B  AR'</VAR> is not), and are at most 16 characters long.
Logical names (environment variables) may also be used to control 
program options and flags; in that case, the routines 
<A HREF = "ENVDBLE.html">ENVDBLE</A> , 
<A HREF = "ENVINT.html">ENVINT</A> , 
<A HREF = "ENVREAL.html">ENVREAL</A> , 
<A HREF = "ENVSTR.html">ENVSTR</A> ,
<A HREF = "ENVYN.html">ENVYN</A> , and 
<A HREF = "NAMEVAL.html"> NAMEVAL() </A> may be used to get the 
value associated with the an environment variable.  
<P>

The I/O API also uses a <A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> standard set 
of logical names  </A> <STRONG>LOGFILE, SCENDESC,</STRONG> and 
<STRONG>EXECUTION_ID</STRONG> for the program's log, the 
scenario/run description file, and the run's execution ID.  
Routine <A HREF = "DSCGRID.html"> DSCGRID() </A>
uses a grid and coordinate description file with logical name 
<A HREF = "GRIDDESC.html"> <STRONG>GRIDDESC</STRONG> </A>.
<P> 

When you run a program that uses the I/O API, you begin with a 
sequence of <VAR>setenv</VAR> commands that set the values for the
program's logical names, much as you begin a (normal) Cray
Fortran program with a sequence of <CODE>ASSIGN</CODE> commands for its
files.  For example, if <VAR>myprogram</VAR> has logical names 
<VAR>FOO</VAR> and <VAR>BAR</VAR> that I want to connect up to files 
<VAR>somedata.mymodel</VAR> and <VAR>otherdata.whatever</VAR> from 
directory <VAR>/tmp/mydir</VAR>, the script for the program would look 
something like:
<PRE>
    ...
    setenv  FOO  /tmp/mydir/somedata.mymodel
    setenv  BAR  /tmp/mydir/otherdata.whatever
    /user/mydir/myprogram
    ...
</PRE><P>

Note that you can declare a file
<A HREF = "BUFFERED.html#vol">&quot;volatile&quot;</A> by adding
a trailing (and quoted, so that <VAR>setenv</VAR> works correctly)
<CODE>&nbsp;-v</CODE> to the value of the logical name, as indicated
below; this has the effect of telling the I/O&nbsp;API to do a
disk-synch before or after every input or output operation on that
file.
<PRE>
    ...
    setenv  QUX  &quot;/tmp/mydir/volatiledata.mymodel -v&quot;
