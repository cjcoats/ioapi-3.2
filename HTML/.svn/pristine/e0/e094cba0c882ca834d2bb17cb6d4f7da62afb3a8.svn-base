<H1>    GRIDDESC </H1>
    
    <STRONG>GRIDDESC</STRONG> is the <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> 
    logical name </A> for text files which store 
    <A HREF = "GRIDS.html#horiz"> horizontal coordinate and 
    grid descriptions,</A> and which is read by the 
    <A HREF = "DSCGRID.html"> DSCGRID() and DSCOORD() </A> 
    utility routines.  This file has two segments.  The first 
    segment has a 1-line header that is always ignored (and which
    by convention provides titles for the columns in the data records),
    a sequence  of data records, and a terminal record with name field
    blank 
    (i.e.  <CODE>'                '</CODE>).
    <P> 
   
    The first segment is the  <STRONG>coordinate-system-description 
    segment</STRONG> and consists  of text records giving coordinate-system 
    name and  descriptive parameters P_ALP, P_BET, P_GAM, XCENT, and YCENT.  
    Note that the <STRONG>standard names for UTM</STRONG> coordinate 
    systems are given in the form <VAR>UTM_&lt;nn&gt;</VAR>, where 
    <VAR>nn</VAR> is the number for the UTM zone.  Most of the 
    Eastern US would use coordinate system UTM_17, for example.
    <P> 
       
    The second segment is the <STRONG>grid-description segment</STRONG>, and  
    consists of text records giving grid name, related coordinate-system name 
    and descriptive parameters  XORIG, YORIG, XCELL, YCELL, NCOLS, NROWS, and 
    NTHIK.  In the usual EDSS modeling situation, there will be both 
    &quot;dot-point&quot; and &quot;cross-point&quot; grids present
    (these grids are topological duals in the sense that the vertices
    (corners) of one correspond to the cell-centers of the other.  The
    interpretation of parameters XORIG, YORIG, XCELL, and YCELL for
    a dot-point and cross-point pair of grids is indicated in the
    accompanying diagram, available in <A HREF = "GRIDS.ps">Postscript</A>, 
    <A HREF = "GRIDS.xbm">X bit-map</A>, 
    <A HREF = "GRIDS.jpg">JPEG</A>, and 
    <A HREF = "GRIDS.gif">GIF</A> image formats.  A similar diagram
    showing the relationship between a cross-point grid and a general
    (thickened) boundary structure is also available in 
    <A HREF = "THKBDY.ps">Postscript</A>, 
    <A HREF = "THKBDY.xbm">X bit-map</A>, 
    <A HREF = "THKBDY.jpg">JPEG</A>, and 
    <A HREF = "THKBDY.gif">GIF</A> image formats.
    <P> 
   
    Each data record in these files consists of two or three
    Fortran-style list-formatted  lines (i.e., items are  separated by
    either blanks or commas).   Name fields are quoted strings, and
    appear on the first of these lines.  Numeric fields are given in
    double precision, and occur on either the second line or the second
    and third (this allows you to organize the text so that it is
    easily viewed in a text editor without running off-screen). The
    records have the following organization, depending upon whether
    they are in the first or second segments.
    <PRE>    
    COORD-NAME
    COORDTYPE, P_ALP, P_BET, P_GAM
    XCENT, YCENT
    
        or
    
    COORD-NAME
    COORDTYPE, P_ALP, P_BET, P_GAM, XCENT, YCENT
    
        and
    
    GRID-NAME
    COORD-NAME, XORIG, YORIG, XCELL, YCELL
    NCOLS, NROWS, NTHIK
    
        or
    
    GRID-NAME
    COORD-NAME, XORIG, YORIG, XCELL, YCELL, NCOLS, NROWS, NTHIK
    </PRE><P>

    Peculiarities of this file-organization are partly due to the
    characteristics of Fortran list-directed input formatting, so
    that the &quot;guts&quot; of the <A HREF = "DSCGRID.html"><CODE>
    DSCGRID()</CODE></A> routine does not have to be an elaborate
    parser but may have a simple structure looking somewhat like
    <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
    ...<BR>
    READ( GDEV,'(A)' ) HEADER<BR>
    ...<BR>
    READ(GDEV,*) NAME<BR>
    IF ( NAME .NE. ' ' ) THEN<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;READ(GDEV,*)COORDTYPE,P_ALP,P_BET,P_GAM,XCENT,YCENT<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
    </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

    <P>
    At most 32 coordinate systems and 256 grids may be listed in 
    one of these files.  These files are small enough to be archived
    easily with a study, and have a sufficiently simple format that new
    ones can easily be constructed &quot;by hand.&quot;
    <P>         

    A <A HREF = "GRIDDESC.txt"><STRONG>sample GRIDDESC file</STRONG></A>
    is available, describing the main computational grids for the SMRAQ
    regional seasonal modeling effort (part of the Southern Oxidant
    Study), the OTAG study, all of the standard ROM AQM computational 
    grids, and all of the standard Urban Airshed Model computational grids.
    <P>
   
    Logical function <A HREF = "DSCGRID.html"> <STRONG>DSCGRID()
    </STRONG> </A> manages access to GRIDDESC (in fact, serves as an
    operational definition of the GRIDDESC file format), and gets grid 
    and  coordinate system descriptive parameters  COORDNAME, P_ALP, P_BET, 
    P_GAM, XCENT, YCENT, XORIG, YORIG, XCELL, YCELL, NCOLS, NROWS, and NTHIK 
    for the specified grid name.  Returns TRUE iff the requested grid 
    is found in the GRIDDESC file.   LOGICAL ENTRY <STRONG>DSCOORD()</STRONG> 
    of DSCGRID() gets coordinate-system descriptive  parameters  
    P_ALP, P_BET, P_GAM, XCENT, and YCENT for the specified coordinate 
    system name (also returning TRUE iff the coordinate system is found
    in the GRIDDESC file).
