<H1>    Program BCWNDW </H1>

<H2> Usage </H2>

    <PRE>
    setenv  &lt;infile&gt;    &lt;path name&gt;
    setenv  &lt;outfile&gt;   &lt;path name&gt;
    bcwndw [&lt;infile&gt; &lt;outfile&gt;]
    </PRE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    where <VAR>infile</VAR> and <VAR>outfile</VAR> are the 
    <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical names </A> of the input 
    and output files.  If they are not present, the program will 
    prompt the user for both input file and output file logical names.
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P> 

<H2> Summary </H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    The <CODE>BCWNDW</CODE> program takes a
    <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#grdded">GRIDDED</A> input file, constructs
    the specified <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#bndary">BOUNDARY</A> data
    structure for a specified subrectangle of the horizontal grid, and
    writes the result to a different Models-3 file for a specified time period.  
    The definition of the subrectangle is specified by bounds 
    <VAR>LOCOL</VAR>, <VAR>LOROW</VAR>, <VAR>HICOL</VAR>, and <VAR>HIROW</VAR> 
    for the columns and rows; the (external) boundary is described by an
    additional parameter <VAR>NTHIK</VAR>:
    <PRE>
    LOCOL &lt;= col &lt;= HICOL
    LOROW &lt;= row &lt;= HIROW
    </PRE>
    where we have the additional constraint that the window, together
    with its external boundary, fit into the grid of the input file:
    <PRE>
    1 &lt;= LOCOL - NTHIK + 1 &lt;= HICOL + NTHIK &lt;= NCOLS
    1 &lt;= LOROW - NTHIK + 1 &lt;= HIROW + NTHIK &lt;= NROWS
    </PRE>

    <STRONG>Before you run the program,</STRONG>  you need to assign <A
    HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical names </A>  to the physical file
    names of both files, according to Models-3  conventions, using the
    operation 
    <PRE>
    &quot;setenv <VAR>&lt;lname&gt; &lt;pname&gt;</VAR>&quot;
    </PRE>
    <STRONG>The program will prompt you</STRONG> for the logical names
    you have chosen for the input files, and then extensively for the
    options  to choose; the prompts will have default responses which
    can be accepted  by hitting &lt;RETURN&gt;.  The specification of
    starting date and time,  target date and time, and duration for the
    run follow Models-3  <A HREF = "DATETIME.html"> date and time
    conventions. </A>
    <P> 

    <STRONG>See also </STRONG> program <A HREF = "M3WNDW.html">m3wndw</A>
    for windowing gridded files.
    <P> 

    If you want to run this program in <STRONG>batch mode</STRONG> 
    (from a script), the recommended way to develop the script is to 
    run the program once interactively noting the pattern of responses 
    to prompts which generate the particular windowing you want.  The 
    pattern of responses then becomes either a command-input file
    which  is redirected into the program in the script, or becomes a 
    &quot;here-document&quot; fed into the execution.
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P> 

    <STRONG>Versions of the program</STRONG> are available for each
    <A HREF = "LIBS.html"> supported architecture </A> (workstation
    versions are currently in the directories  <VAR>/env/apps/(SunOS5 |
    IRIX5 | alphaOSF1)/bin</VAR>; Cray versions are in
    <VAR>/work/xcc/m3tools</VAR> on <VAR>sequoia</VAR>) and
