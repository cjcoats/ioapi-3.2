    There isn't one; however, you can usually call these routines
    from C if you do it right (all arguments pass by reference; the
    C caller will see the subroutine as &quot;void cbarnes1_&quot;
    (etc.) under most UNIX systems, &quot;void cbarnes1&quot; for
    IBM AIX or HP HP-UX, or &quot;void CBARNES1&quot; for Crays.)

<H2> Summary: </H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    CBARNES1() grids one variable Z and CBARNESN() grids an array
    ov variables ZN, from locations with lat-lon coordinates 
    &lt;YLAT(1...NP),XLON(1...NP)&gt; and produce output array
    GRID(1...NG) or GRIDN(1...NG,1...NV) at the locations 
    &lt;LAT(1...NG),LON(1...NG)&gt;.  For gridding purposes, NG should
    be NCOLS*NROWS; the CBARNES routines will regard the corresponding
    output array as single indexed in the first subscript.
    <P> 

    These routines are an extension of a spatial analysis technique with
    scale dependent filtering that was originally proposed by Stanly
    Barnes in 1964 and was expanded in 1973.  The scale dependent
    response function of the filtering effect is analytically
    calculable and can be adjusted by the choice of two parameters in
    the Gaussian weighting function used.
    <P> 

    Input data point locations should be specified in latitude and
    longitude degrees.  The separation distances between these data
    points and the grid points where the estimates are made is
    calculated from a function that is determined by spherical geometry
    under the assumption of a spherical Earth.
    <P> 

    These routines were modified by Carlie Coats from routines
    originally produced for the EPA Regional Oxidant Model and 
    adapted also for UAM BEIS.  They use &quot;exact&quot;
    spherical-geometry distance formulas instead of the
    &quot;flat-earth&quot; approximations used earlier, as well
    as correct calculation of residuals instead of the earlier
    incomplete linear-interpolation approximation of the residuals.
    <P> 

    Note that there are not explicit <VAR>MODULE M3UTILIO</VAR>
    <CODE>INTERFACE</CODE>s for these routines, because of the
    single-indexing frequently employed by their callers.
