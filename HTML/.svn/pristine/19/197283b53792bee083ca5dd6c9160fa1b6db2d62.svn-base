<H1>    Program SELMRG2D </H1>

<H2> Usage </H2>
<PRE>
    setenv  &lt;infile1&gt;    &lt;path name&gt;
    ...
    setenv  &lt;infileN&gt;    &lt;path name&gt;
    setenv  &lt;outfile&gt;    &lt;path name&gt;
    selmrg2d <VAR>(and answer the prompts)</VAR>
</PRE>
where <VAR>infile1</VAR>, ...,<VAR>infileN</VAR>, and
<VAR>outfile</VAR> are the <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html">logical  names
</A> of the input and output files. 
<P> 

<H2> Summary </H2>


The <CODE>SELMRG2D</CODE> program extracts multiple user-selected 2D 
<A HREF = "VBLE.html">variable</A>/layer combinations for a specified
time step sequence  from multiple gridded I/O&nbsp;API files,
<VAR>infile1</VAR>, ..., <VAR>infileN</VAR> and writes them to a
different single-layer gridded I/O&nbsp;API file, <VAR>outfile</VAR>.
The input files <VAR>infile1</VAR>, ..., <VAR>infileN</VAR> must all
have the same horizontal grid structure, althought they are not required 
to have the same vertical grid structure (or be single-layered, having
no vertical structure at all).
<P>
 
The normal use of <CODE>SELMRG2D</CODE> is to script the production of
files for input to 2-D graphics/visualization programs, e.g., for the
automated graphical web-page-delivered analyses needed in various
real-time meteorology/air quality forecasting projects such as 
<A HREF = "http://www.baronams.com:/projects/NAQP/">NCSC's Numerical Air Quality Prediction
Project</A>.
<P>

Requires Fortran-90 for compilation.
<P>

<STRONG>Before you run the program,</STRONG> 
you need to assign <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical names </A>  to
the physical file names of the input and output files according to
Models-3 conventions, using the operation 
<PRE>
    &quot;setenv <VAR>&lt;lname&gt; &lt;pname&gt;</VAR>&quot;
</PRE>
<STRONG>The program will prompt you</STRONG> for 
<UL>
    <LI>  the logical names you have chosen for the input files, 
    <LI>  for each input file, repeatedly for
          <UL> 
              <LI>  the variable to select,
              <LI>  if the input file has multiple layers, the 
                    layer to select, and
              <LI>  the output name to use for this variable/layer
          </UL> 
    <LI>  the logical name for the output file, and 
    <LI>  the time step sequence to process:
          <UL> 
              <LI>  starting date, format YYYYDDD,
              <LI>  starting date, format HHMMSS, and
              <LI>  the run duration, format HHMMSS.
          </UL> 
</UL>
The prompts have default responses indicated  in square brackets
<CODE>[LIKE THIS]</CODE>, which can be accepted  by hitting
&lt;RETURN&gt;.  The specification of starting date and time, target
date and time, and number of time step records for the run follow 
Models-3 <A HREF = "DATETIME.html"> date and time conventions. </A>
<P> 

If you want to run this program in <STRONG>batch mode</STRONG> 
(from a script), the recommended way to develop the script is to 
run the program once interactively noting the pattern of responses 
to prompts which generate the particular analysis you want.  The 
pattern of responses then becomes either a command-input file which 
you may redirect into the program in the script, or may become a 
&quot;here-document&quot; fed into the execution by the script.
