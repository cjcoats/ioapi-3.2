<H1>    Program VERTOT </H1>

<H2> Usage </H2>
<PRE>
    setenv  &lt;infile&gt;    &lt;path name&gt;
    setenv  &lt;outfile&gt;   &lt;path name&gt;
    setenv  &lt;statfile&gt;  &lt;path name&gt;
    ...
    vertot [&lt;infile&gt;]
</PRE>
where <VAR>infile</VAR>, <VAR>outfile</VAR>, and <VAR>statfile</VAR> are
the <A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical names </A> of the input,
optional output, and optional report files (as found in the 
<A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> environment</A>; the program will prompt 
the user for input and output file logical names (as appropriate for
the context).
<P> 
 
<H2> Summary </H2>

The <CODE>VERTOT</CODE> program compute vertical-column totals for each 
specified <A HREF = "VBLE.html"> variable </A> in a user-specified 
<A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#grdded"> GRIDDED </A> Models-3 file.
Optionally, it will put the output to a user-specified 1-layer GRIDDED
output file, and  optionally write statistics to the log.  (You want to
choose at least one of these options :-).)
If statistics output is chose, then for each time step for each variable, 
the program reports statistics on vertical totals of that variable to the 
<A HREF = "ENVIRONMENT.html"> program log </A> or to the 
<VAR>statfile</VAR>.  Note that <STRONG>VERTOT does not make sense for
concentration data</STRONG>, but only for data in units (e.g.,
mass units) which can be summed.  Vertical totals of concentration
data would require the use of density to convert the data into a
summable form.
<P> 

A restriction at present is that the <A HREF = "DATATYPES.html#basic"> 
basic data type </A> of all variables extracted must be REAL.
<P> 

<STRONG>Before you run the program,</STRONG> you need to assign a 
<A HREF = "LOGICALS.html"> logical name </A> to the physical file
names of both files, according to Models-3 conventions, using the 
operation 
<PRE>
    &quot;setenv <VAR>&lt;lname&gt; &lt;pname&gt;</VAR>&quot;
</PRE>
<STRONG>The program will prompt you</STRONG> for the logical name you
have chosen for the input file, and then extensively for the options 
to choose; the prompts will have default responses which can be accepted 
by hitting &lt;RETURN&gt;.  The specification of starting date and time, 
and duration for the analysis follow Models-3 
<A HREF = "DATETIME.html"> date and time conventions. </A>
<P> 

Note that the set of analyses which can be performed by one execution
of VERTOT is quite complex.  If you want to run this program in 
<STRONG>batch mode</STRONG> (from a script), the recommended way 
to develop the script is to run the program once interactively 
noting the pattern of responses to prompts which generate the 
particular analysis you want.  The pattern of responses then 
becomes either a command-input file which is redirected into 
the program in the script, or becomes a &quot;here-document&quot; 
fed into the execution.
<P>
