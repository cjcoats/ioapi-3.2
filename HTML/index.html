    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    The Models-3/EDSS Input/Output Applications Programming Interface
    (I/O&nbsp;API) provides the environmental model developer with an
    easy-to-learn, easy-to-use <STRONG>programming library for data
    storage and access</STRONG>, available from both Fortran and C.  The
    same routines can be used for both file storage (using netCDF files)
    and model coupling (using PVM mailboxes). It is the standard data
    access library for both the NCSC/CMAS's EDSS project and EPA's
    Models-3, CMAQ, and SMOKE, as well as various other atmospheric and
    hydrological modeling systems. There was a external-package wrapper for
    the I/O&nbsp;API in the <A HREF = "http://wrf-model.org/index.php">Weather
    Research and Forecasting Model [WRF]</A>, which optionally uses I/O&nbsp;API
    for output, enabling the use of I/O&nbsp;API coupling mode to couple
    WRF-Chem with SMOKE&mdash;an effort unfortunately dropped by NCAR.
    <P>

    Since it is built around an <STRONG>object based conception of
    environmental modeling</STRONG>, the I/O&nbsp;API provides a variety
    of data structure types for organizing the data, and a set of access
    routines which offer selective direct access to the data in terms
    meaningful to the modeler. For example,
         <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
         Read layer 1 of variable 'OZONE' from 'CONCFILE' for
         5:00&nbsp;PM GMT on July&nbsp;19, 1988 and put the result
         into array&nbsp;A.
         </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    is a direct English translation of a typical I/O&nbsp;API
    <CODE>READ3()</CODE> call. &quot;Selective direct access&quot; means
    that this <CODE>READ3</CODE> call retrieves exactly this ozone data
    immediately.  It does not have to read through previous  hours of
    data, nor whatever other variables (such as <VAR>NOX</VAR> or
    <VAR>PAN</VAR>) are in what order in the file.  Data can be read or
    written in any order (or not at all). This characteristic provides
    the following advantages:
    <UL>
        <LI> <STRONG>performance:</STRONG> visualization and analysis
             programs looking at  selected parts of the data don't need
             to read unrequested data from the files.

        <LI> <STRONG>modularity:</STRONG>  Data can be read or written
             in any order (or not at all).  The same input files serve
             both CMAQ and MAQSIP engineering models and full-chemistry
             models -- the former reading just a few of the variables
             from the files, the latter reading most of them. The
             modular-model structure used for CMAQ, MAQSIP, and Models-3
             depends upon this.

        <LI> <STRONG>simplicity:</STRONG>  data is presented in
             real-world/modeling terms:  no calculation of record
             numbers, etc., is needed (nor is the data accessed in
             run-specific terms).

        <LI> <STRONG>robustness:</STRONG>  data are "tagged" by name,
             date, and time; miscounted record-numbers don't scramble
             temperatures with pressures, for example.
    </UL>

    I/O&nbsp;API files also have the following characteristics
    <UL>
        <LI>  They are <STRONG>machine-independent</STRONG> and
              network-transparent, except for the NCEP native-binary
              mode.  Files created on a Cray can be read on a desktop
              workstation (or vice versa) either via NFS mounting or
              FTP, with no further translation necessary.

        <LI>  They are <STRONG>self-describing</STRONG> -- that is, they
              contain headers which provide a complete set of information
              necessary to use and interpret the data they contain.

        <LI>  The API provides automated  built-in mechanisms to support
              <STRONG>production application requirements</STRONG> for
              histories and audit trails:
              <UL>
                  <LI> ID of the program execution which produced the
                       file
                  <LI> Description of the study scenario in which
                       the file was generated
              </UL>

        <LI>  They support a <STRONG>variety of data types</STRONG> used in
              the environmental sciences (each of which can be
              <STRONG>vertically layered</STRONG> or not, as needed),
              among them
              <UL>
                  <LI>  <VAR>gridded</VAR> (e.g., concentration fields or
                        meteorology-model temperatures)

                  <LI>  <VAR>grid-boundary</VAR> (for air quality model
                        boundary conditions)

                  <LI>  <VAR>scattered</VAR> (e.g., meteorology
                        observations or source level emissions)

                  <LI>  <VAR>sparse matrix</VAR> (as used in the
                        SMOKE emissions model)

                  <LI>  <VAR>User customized&nbsp;/&nbsp;vector</VAR> to cover other
                        potential applications.

              </UL>

        <LI>  They support three different <STRONG>time step
              structures:</STRONG>
              <UL>
                  <LI>  <VAR>time-stepped</VAR> (with regular time-steps) like
                        hourly model-output concentration fields or
                        twice-daily upper air meteorology observation
                        profiles, or
                  <LI>  <VAR>time-independent</VAR> like terrain height.
                  <LI>  <VAR>restart,</VAR> which maintains
                        &quot;even&quot; and &quot;odd&quot;
                        time step records, so that restart data
                        does not consume an inordinate amount of
                        disk space
              </UL>
    </UL>
    <P>

    The I/O&nbsp;API also contains an extensive set of utility routines
    for manipulating dates and times, performing coordinate conversions,
    storing and recalling grid definitions, sparse matrix arithmetic,
    etc., as well as a set of data-manipulation and statistical analysis
    programs.  It has an extensive documentation set, including
    <UL>
        <LI>  <A HREF = "TUTORIAL.html">tutorial</A>;
        <LI>  <A HREF = "REQUIREMENTS.html">requirements document</A>;
        <LI>  <A HREF = "AA.html">indexes and user manuals</A>
              for data access routines, utility routines, date/time
              manipulation routines, and analysis programs;
        <LI>  <A HREF = "AA.html#tools">Data-manipulation,
              geospatial-transform, and statistical-analysis
              programs</A>
        <LI>  <A HREF = "SAMPLE.html">several sample programs</A>
    </UL>
    <P>

    Various <A HREF = "NEWSTUFF.html">extensions and research
    efforts</A>  to the I/O&nbsp;API have been developed or are under
    development. Developments include the use of the I/O&nbsp;API
    interacting with PVM for model coupling, and adding operations to
    read or write entire time series (with multiple time steps) as
    single operations, and research projects include data-parallel I/O
    and a very powerful &quot;geospatial cell complex&quot; data type
    with polygonal-cell decompositions that may be both time independent
    (as for finite elememt modeling) and time dependent (as for
    moving-mesh plume-in-grid modeling).
